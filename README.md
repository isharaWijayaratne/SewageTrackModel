# **SEWAGE-TRACK model**
---

I enhanced and implemented the SEWAGE-TRACK model, which involved managing raster data using Python. For this, I utilized the `rasterio`, `geopandas`, and `pandas` packages to efficiently handle spatial data. The model was designed to analyze the distribution of wastewater generated by 19 countries across the Middle East and North Africa, with the goal of promoting sustainable wastewater reuse. To ensure the model's accuracy, I validated the TIF and SHP files it produced by comparing them with available data using QGIS software.
